# TODO: Fix White Screen Issue on Netlify

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed project structure and code
- [x] Tested local build (passed)
- [x] Added MUI ThemeProvider and CssBaseline to App.tsx
- [x] Added socket error handling to ChatBox.tsx and TicTacToe.tsx
- [x] Tested build after changes (passed)
- [x] Started local preview server

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test the app in browser using preview server
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify and check for white screen
- [ ] If still issues, check Netlify build logs
- [ ] Set VITE_SERVER_URL in Netlify env vars if server is deployed separately
- [ ] Add error handling to other game components if needed

## Notes
- App now has proper MUI setup, which should prevent rendering issues.
- Socket connections now log errors instead of potentially crashing.
- Ensure server is deployed and VITE_SERVER_URL is set for full functionality.
